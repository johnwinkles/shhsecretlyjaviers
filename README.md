About me
* ѕєвαѕтιαη // ѕєв
*
* ! Most people know me as Sebastian or Seb, I don’t rlly mind if you call me by my nickname! (I love the nicknames..)
* -Extreme introvert, but when you get to know me I’m more energetic and pleasing to hang out with. Most of the time I’m not rlly active on pt! But I enjoy c+h when inactive.
Speaking of pt, you will mostly see me in horror characters ! I mainly use my Michael Myers skin.. (rlly obsessed with it) Jason Voorhees comes in use when I’m getting bored of the Michael myers skin. LOVE BILLY! I remade him totally obsessed. I have others- but don’t rlly want this to be long.
Don’t be shy and int! I love interacting with people, but I don’t rlly come up first.. if you’re too shy then don't! I absolutely don’t force people to int.
